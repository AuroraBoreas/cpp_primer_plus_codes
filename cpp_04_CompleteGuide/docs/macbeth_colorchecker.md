## what is macbeth colorchecker?

“The ColorChecker Color Rendition Chart (often referred to by its original name, the Macbeth ColorChecker[1] or simply Macbeth chart[2]) is a **color calibration target** consisting of a cardboard-framed arrangement of 24 squares of painted samples. 

The ColorChecker was introduced in a 1976 paper by McCamy, Marcus, and Davidson in the Journal of Applied Photographic Engineering.[3]

## why?

The chart’s color patches have **spectral reflectances** intended to **mimic those of natural objects** such as human skin, foliage, and flowers, to have consistent color appearance under a variety of lighting conditions, especially as detected by typical color photographic film, and to be stable over time.”

## usage

The venerable Macbeth ColorChecker chart has shown an amazing resurgence in use and popularity in the digital photography era, proving especially popular in digital camera profiling applications and for many print quality control tests as well.

Because the chart’s visual appearance is so well known in the photographic community Aardenburg Imaging repurposed its 24 assigned colorimetric values as the core group of color patches in our standard 30 patch color target we use to test lightfastness of modern inks and media.

These color values do a great job exercising critical color blend transitions in muliticolor channel inkjet printers while economizing on the number of patches needed to properly evaluate an ink set’s overall light fade characteristics.

- economizing on the number of patches needed to properly evaluate an overall light fade characteristics.

The ColorChecker consists of a series of six gray patches, plus typical additive (Red-Green-Blue) and subtractive (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow) primaries, plus other "natural" colors such as light and dark skin, sky-blue, foliage, etc. The color pigments were selected for optimum color constancy when comparing pictures of the chart with pictures of the natural colors... as reproduced on color film! Optimizing the human visual match was thus not the first priority; still, it was shown, by the chart designers, that the degree of metamerism was also very small when directly comparing the chart to the natural colors. Expressed otherwise, the perceived colors of the ColorChecker vary in the same way as the natural colors they represent when the light source changes*, either when imaged on film or compared directly.

Traditionally seen in photography magazines, in articles dealing with color film rendition, the chart has found a renewed interest with the advent of digital cameras. In view of what was mentioned above relative to the ColorChecker being optimized for film based reproduction, it could be argued that this optimization would not be ideal for the sensors of these new cameras. However, because the imaging sub-systems of all digital cameras are specifically designed to mimic the response of the human visual system, there is no major reason why the ColorChecker's natural color patches should not be trusted as valid substitutes for their natural counterparts in various lighting conditions**. And what about the other non-natural colors, the additive and subtractive primaries, and the gray scale patches, which are not designed to be equivalent to a particular real-life color? They were valid then, and they still are. In reality, the patches of a color chart do not need to be surrogates of natural objects to make them useful, but the fact that some of the ColorChecker patches can be used in such a way is a definite plus.
