here we go brrr

- how constructors and destructors are defined to create and destroy objects
- how inline methods, access methods, and read-only methods can be used
- the pointer `this`, which is available for all methods, and
- what u need to pay attention to when passing objects as arguments or returning objects
  
## TBD
