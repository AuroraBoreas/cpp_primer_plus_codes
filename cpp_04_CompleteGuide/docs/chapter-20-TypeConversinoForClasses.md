# Type Conversino For Classes

(462)

Implicit type conversion occurs in C++ when an expression cannot be compiled directly but can be compiled after applying a conversion rule.

The programmer can stipulate how the compiler will perform implicit type conversion for classes by defining conversion constructors and functions.

Finally, we discuss ambiguity occurring due to type conversion and how to avoid it.
