## macros

C++ has a simple mechanism for naming constants or sequences of commands, that is for defining macros.

u simply use the preprocessor's #define directive.

```c++

// macro syntax
#define name substitutetext

// note that neither an equals sign nor a semicolon is used,
// as these would become part of the substitute text.

```

merit of macros

1. good readability
2. easy to modify

demerit of macros

- the substitute text is inserted and re-compiled each time the macro is called. 
- for this reason, a macro may inflate the object file each time the macro is called.
- thus, a macro should contain only a few statements to avoid inflation

it is possible to call macros with arguments.
to do so, u must supply the appropriate parameters when defining the macro. the parameters are replaced by valid arguments at runtime.

example

```c++

#define SQUARE(a)   ((a)*(a))
z = SQUARE(x+1);

/*
why ((a)*(a)) but not (a * a)?

this example also shows that u must be careful when using brackets to indicate parameters for macros.

omitting the brackets in the previous example, SQUARE, would cause the expression to be expanded as follows.

- parameters with brackets, z = (x+1) * (x+1)
- omitting brackets of parameters, z = x + 1 * x + 1

outer brackets in the definition ensure that even when the macro is used in a complex expression, the square is calculated before the result can be used for any further calculations.

|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| macro         | visible to compiler; inflatable in runtime; no check arg types                        |
| function      | compiled independently to executable; caller prg branches to function; check arg type |
| inline func   | lambda? no. just using an `inline` flag to mark up a function is within main program  |

## redefining macros

| directives          |   explanation              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| #define NAME(args)  | define macros              |
| #undef NAME         | remove macros              |

so, to redefine a macros, u have to #undef it then #define it again.

example as follows

```c++
#define MIN(a, b) ((a)<(b)? (a) : (b))
... // here MIN can be called
#undef MIN

```

## conditional inclusion

syntax:

```c++

#ifdef name
... // block, which will be compiled if name is defined.
#else
...
#endif

```

a symbol w/o a substitute text is often used to identify header files and avoid multiple inclusion.

sample

```c++
#ifndef _ARTICLE_
#define _ARTICLE_
... // content of the header file
#endif

```

## case conversion

header files: `ctype.h` and `cctype`

functionality: classify or convert single characters

## filter programs

```c++

while(cin.get(c)) {...}

// or
while(getline(cin, line)) {...} // getline(cin, line) is true while a line can be read

```
