# templates

(742)

templates allow u to construct both functions and classes based on types that have not yet been stated. thus, templates are a powerful tool for automating program code generation.

topics:

- how to define and use function and class templates
- in addition, special options, such as default args, specialization, and explicit instantiation are covered.

## functions and class templates

template and instantiation

### motivation

c++ allows u to define templates -- parameterized families of related functions or classes:

- a `function template` defines a group of statements for a function using a parameter instead of a concrete type
- a `class template` specifies a class definition using a parameter instead of a concrete type.

### advantage of templates

templates are powerful programming tools

- a template need only be coded once
- a template offers uniform solution for similar problems allowing type-independent code to be tested early in the development phase
- errors caused by multiple encoding are avoided
